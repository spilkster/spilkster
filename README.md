Simon Pilkington - OpenClaw Maintainer

I started my career as a mechanical engineer, designing systems and solving challenges in the automotive and aerospace industries. I have been key to the launch of successful companies in advanced manufacturing, software, and finance.

I now spend my time thinking about the opportunities and challenges of the near and not-so-near future. I maximise my impact by supporting early stage entrepreneurs focused on exciting new technologies that will create a bright future for humanity and our planet. I am a limited partner at several interesting funds and also an independent angel investor.
